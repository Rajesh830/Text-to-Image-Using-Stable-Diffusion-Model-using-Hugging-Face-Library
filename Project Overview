AI-Powered Visual Generation with Stable Diffusion 2.1
This project demonstrates the transformative capabilities of generative AI by leveraging the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model to convert textual prompts into realistic, high-quality images. With GPU acceleration and Python's robust ecosystem of libraries, this implementation streamlines the process of creating visuals, making it accessible for both beginners and advanced users.

Features
State-of-the-Art Model: Uses the Stable Diffusion 2.1 model for photorealistic image generation.
Text-to-Image Generation: Converts user-defined textual prompts into high-quality visuals.
GPU Acceleration: Leverages CUDA-enabled GPUs for faster processing and near-real-time outputs.
User-Friendly Workflow: Implements a straightforward pipeline using Python libraries like diffusers, torch, and Pillow.

Requirements
Python 3.8+
CUDA-enabled GPU (for GPU acceleration)
Libraries: diffusers, torch, Pillow
For detailed installation instructions, refer to the requirements.txt file.

How It Works
Text Input: Enter a user-defined textual prompt.
Model Processing: The Stable Diffusion 2.1 model interprets the input and generates an image.
GPU Acceleration: Utilizes GPU for faster computation and output generation.
Image Output: The final image is saved and displayed using the Pillow library.
Future Enhancements
Add support for fine-tuning the Stable Diffusion model.
Build a web-based interface for interactive image generation.
Explore multi-modal inputs (text + image).
